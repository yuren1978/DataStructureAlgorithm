//3. Find the number of an element in a sorted array
//For instance,  2223333444555,   num_occurrence(4) for this array is  3.

//We use two binary search to find the start and end index of  'num'. The time complexity of this is O(logN). N is the length of the array.
//To find the boundary, the two binaries search will not stop when an element that equals to 'num' is found. Instead, it continues until the boundary is reached.
